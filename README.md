# stopwatch

A new Flutter project. This app runs on Android devices.

This is a stopwatch with features like:
1. Start: Allows users to start the stopwatch.
2. Stop: Allows users to stop the stopwatch.
3. Reset: Allows users to reset the stopwatch to zero.
4. Lap: Allows users to record lap times while the stopwatch runs.
5. Persistent Storage: Stores lap times even when the app is closed or restarted.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. It uses shared preferences for storing the lap time locally just to restore the lap times even when the app is closed or restarted
